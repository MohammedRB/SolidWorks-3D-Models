# SolidWorks-3D-Models
3D Models I have made in SolidWorks

These files were made during my free time or during the SolidWorks courses/ lessons as part of my Mechanical Engineering Degree.
Feel free to take a look at my work, try to copy it to help you practice your SolidWork skills ;]
I will add more of my work as time goes on (if I remember to).
